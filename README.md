Tiny Freight is a library implementation of a generic cross-application data-exchange framework which can be seem as 'the freight service for data'. 

The core technology of the framework is an unconventional object-serialization method that uses a novel data format, called Recursive Delimited Array or RDA, as the data transport media.
