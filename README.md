# Freightman

Freightman is a lightweight data-transport system for cross-application data communication, by using an elegant and unconventional data-serialization method.

Freightman allows seamlessly transferring structured data (e.g. objects of nested classes) cross-language and cross-platform, and is much simpler to implement compared to solutions using other data-serialization methods.

## A "Post Office" style data-exchange scenario

When sending a parcel via Post-office, there are three parties involved in the process - 
* A sender:
* The Post office:
* A receiver:

Freightman's data-exchange process closely assembles the Post Office scenario -

* A sending application:
* The Post office:
* A receiving application:


## An "universal" data container 

## About this project

This project is a library implementation of the Freightman data transport system.


## A step-by-step data-exchange example using SDD

## What are the benefits (i.e. the 'pros')?

### simplicity

### flexibility

## What's the catch (i.e. the 'cons')?

The burden of packing and unpacking. 

Get used to a new way of thinking: there is no schema to design and to maintain. Your code is the schema and is where you maintain your data structure.
