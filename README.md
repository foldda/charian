# Simple Data Delivery
Simple Data Delivery (SDD) is a generic cross-application data-exchange framework dubbed as "the Post Office service for data-exchange". 

The key technology of the framework is an unconventional object-serialization method using a novel data format, called Recursive Delimited Array or RDA, as the data transport media.

## The concept: a "Post Office" service for data exchange


## The key technology: an "universal" data container

## What are the benefits (i.e. the 'pros')?

### simplicity

### flexibility

## What's the catch (i.e. the 'cons')?

The burden of packing and unpacking. 

Get used to a new way of thinking: there is no schema to design and to maintain. Your code is the schema and is where you maintain your data structure.
