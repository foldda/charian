# Freightman

Freightman is a lightweight data-transport system for cross-application data communication.

Freightman's unconventional data-serialization method, using Recursive Delimited Array (RDA) as the data-encoding format, allows seamlessly data transfer cross-language and cross-platform, and is much simpler to implement and manage compared to the other data-serialization solutions.

## A "Post Office" style data-exchange scenario


## An "universal" data container 

## About this project

This project is a library implementation of the Freightman data transport system.


## A step-by-step data-exchange example using SDD

## What are the benefits (i.e. the 'pros')?

### simplicity

### flexibility

## What's the catch (i.e. the 'cons')?

The burden of packing and unpacking. 

Get used to a new way of thinking: there is no schema to design and to maintain. Your code is the schema and is where you maintain your data structure.
