# Cordial
Cordial is a data transport framework for generic cross-application data exchange.

Cordial uses an unconventional data-serialization method for data transport, and it is capable to transfer data between applications in different programming languages and on different computer platforms. Compared to systems that use other data-serialization methods and solutions, Cordial is much simpler and extremely lightweight, thanks to its innovative approach and a new serializable data-encoding format called Recursive Delimited Array (RDA).

## A step-by-step data-exchange example using SDD

## What are the benefits (i.e. the 'pros')?

### simplicity

### flexibility

## What's the catch (i.e. the 'cons')?

The burden of packing and unpacking. 

Get used to a new way of thinking: there is no schema to design and to maintain. Your code is the schema and is where you maintain your data structure.
